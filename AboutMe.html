        <p> Hey there (whoever you are)! I'm a first year Computer Science Engineering (CSE) major + Statistics minor at UC Irvine. I developed a passion for computer science
            after taking an introductory class at my high school in freshman year, and have continued pursuing my interest in the field ever since. Although I'm
            familiar with a decent range of languages, my go-to language is Java, just because I've spent the most time on it and it requires more specificity than languages like Python.
            Over the last few weeks of summer, I self taught myself web development languages like HTML/CSS and am currently working on Javascript. I'm always willing to step out of
            my comfort zone and try something new, whether that be in programming or real life. In my free time, I enjoy watching Youtube tutorials, biking, and the occasional video game. This website
            is one of my many products, but if you have any suggestions or critiques feel free to reach out and let me know!</p>
